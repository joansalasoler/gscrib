Gscrib: Supercharge G-code with Python
======================================

**Gscrib** is a Python library built to enhance your CNC, 3D printing,
and automated fabrication workflows. It offers a powerful suite of tools
for generating, transforming, and optimizing toolpaths, enabling creators
to write clean, efficient, and highly customizable G-code with ease.

Is This the Right Tool for You?
-------------------------------

Traditional G-code is the backbone of CNC and 3D printing, but as designs
become more intricate, it can quickly become cumbersome, error-prone, and
hard to maintain. **Gscrib** takes your G-code to the next level, offering
a more organized, structured, and flexible approach to G-code.

With **Gscrib**, you can incorporate high-level logic, automation, and
customization without needing advanced software development skills.
Whether you're generating complex toolpaths, dynamically adjusting
parameters, or managing multiple machine aspects, **Gscrib** makes it
simple and intuitive.

Powerful Yet Simple
-------------------

**Gscrib** is designed for users who want the power of Python without the
complexity. Here's how it makes G-code creation easier and more efficient:

- **Readability & Maintainability**: Say goodbye to cryptic, error-prone
  G-code. **Gscrib** lets you write clean, readable scripts that are easy
  to modify and debug.
- **Reusable Code**: Automate tasks and create modular, reusable scripts
  that save you time and effort across projects.
- **Error-Free G-code**: Avoid mistakes with automatic error-checking
  that ensures your G-code is always safe and correct.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate with other systems (CNC
  controllers, 3D printers, and more) for a fully customized solution.
- **Automate tasks**: Easily generate complex toolpaths like arcs,
  splines, and spirals, without manually calculating each point.
- **Device Sensors**: Read real-time machine data such as position,
  temperature, and other sensor values directly from connected devices.
- **Add custom logic**: Modify your G-code on the fly with hooks for
  real-time adjustments, such as adding extrusion or managing speeds.
- **Effortless Transformations**: Apply translations, rotations, and
  scaling to your toolpaths with just a few lines of code.
- **Multiple Output Options**: Write your G-code not just to files, but
  directly to connected devices via serial ports or network sockets.

Even if you're not a Python expert, **Gscrib** integrates seamlessly
into your workflow, giving you unmatched control over your machines.

Why Choose Gscrib?
------------------

If you're happy with standard G-code and don't need to generate complex
toolpaths or customize the process, then plain G-code might suffice for
your needs. However, if you're regularly working with complicated parts
or looking for ways to automate your process, **Gscrib** will make your
workflow faster, more precise, and more flexible.

- **Save Time & Reduce Errors**: Automate repetitive tasks and reuse
  scripts, speeding up your workflow while reducing mistakes.
- **Manage Complex Operations Easily**: From tool control to machine
  states, **Gscrib** simplifies managing intricate operations.
- **Stay in Control**: Get flexible, powerful G-code that you can
  customize to fit your exact needs while keeping your process clean
  and efficient.

With **Gscrib**, you're not just writing G-code —you're writing smarter,
more efficient programs that adapt to your needs.

Aim of the Project
------------------

The goal of **Gscrib** is to offer an intuitive and flexible solution
for generating G-code programs.
