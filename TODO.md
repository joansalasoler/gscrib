# TODO List

This is a wish-list of potential features and improvements for the
project. Please note that there is no guarantee these features will ever
be implemented. However, contributions towards implementing any of these
features are very welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests, open issues,
or suggest additional ideas to help improve the project.

## Add Support for More G-code Commands

Enhance G-code compatibility by supporting the following commands:

* G43, G44: Implement Tool Length Compensation
* M106: Add support for controlling multiple fans.
* M141: Implement Chamber Temperature control.

## Ensure Selected Plane Affects Interpolated Paths

Make sure that the selected plane (XY, XZ, or YZ) influences the
generation of interpolated paths during G-code generation. Even when
matrix transformations are in play, allowing the selected plane to
affect the PathTracer method improves user experience and simplifies
code generation.

## Iterators for Grids, Polygons, and More

Implement convenient iterators for common geometric structures, such as
grids, polygons, and other shapes. This functional approach will simplify
the creation of complex paths, enabling users to easily define operations
across regular patterns without manually calculating each point.

## Simple Ordering Algorithms

Implement functions to reorder a set of points generated by iterators
(e.g., grid(), hexagonal_grid()) using various traversal patterns like
row major, column major, zigzag, meander, nearest neighbor, shortest
path (TSP), random, or Hilbert curve.

## Add Common Hooks for Standard Operations

Extend the existing hook system by adding the most common operations,
such as automatic filament extrusion, limiting feed rates, temperature
adjustments, and other frequently needed actions.

## Expand Axis Support Beyond X, Y, and Z

Extend support to additional axes (e.g., A, B, C, U, V, W) beyond the
currently supported X, Y, and Z. While additional axes can be set as
keyword parameters, they are not fully integrated into the system.

## Read Machine Sensors for Adaptive G-code Generation

When direct write is enabled, implement functionality to read machine
sensors (e.g., temperature, fan speeds, etc.). This feature will allow
dynamic adjustment of G-code, ensuring more precise control over the
machine's operations by reacting to real-time sensor readings.

## HeightMap Integration

Explore the feasibility of integrating heightmaps into the system to
dynamically adjust Z-height based on surface variations. Currently, a
basic raster-based heightmap implementation is available through the
Vpype-Gscrib plugin.

## Scaffolding System

Scaffolding means creating a basic structure for a program. Implement a
extendable scaffolding system that provides common templates for G-code
programs, including initialization, error handling, and shutdown sequences.

## Speeds, Feeds and Temperature Calculators

Investigate the feasibility of integrating a comprehensive speeds,
feeds and temperature calculator into the system. Additionally, provide
hooks to dynamically adjust these values during G-code generation.

## Estimate Machining Time

Implement a function to estimate machining time based on speeds, feeds
and traveled distances.
